# RobinHoodTradingBot
This is a hypothetical trading bot that uses the Robinhood API to extract data about technical indicators. It plots technical analysis data to let the user know to buy or sell the security. The project was developed in PyCharm using python. There are three files that make the essential parts of the program.

The three files are the following:

1. main.py
2. tradestrategy.py
3. plots.py

The main.py file is used for the control flow of the application. 
The tradestrategy.py file is used to calculate tehcnical analysis on an equity and then make a decision on whether to buy or sell that equity.
The plots.py file is used to plot the technical indicators from the tradestrategy.py file.
