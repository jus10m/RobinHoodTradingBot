# RobinHoodTradingBot
This is a hypothetical trading bot that uses the Robinhood API to extract data about technical indicators. It plots technical analysis data to let the user know to buy or sell the security. The project was developed in PyCharm using python. There are three classes that make the essential parts of the program.
